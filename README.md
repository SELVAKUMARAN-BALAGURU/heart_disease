# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to **predict the likelihood of heart disease** in a patient using various health-related features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other medical attributes.  
The model is built and tested using **Python**, leveraging machine learning techniques for accurate health predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of heart disease can help in taking preventive measures.  
This notebook demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained on healthcare data to predict the probability of heart disease.

## 🧠 Objectives

- To preprocess and analyze patient health data  
- To train and evaluate multiple ML models    
- To predict whether a person is at risk or not

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning algorithms and metrics

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `age` | Age of the patient |
| `sex` | Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) |
| `cp` | Chest pain type (4 values) |
| `trestbps` | Resting blood pressure |
| `chol` | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl |
| `fbs` | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) |
| `restecg` | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| `thalach` | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| `exang` | Exercise induced angina |
| `oldpeak` | ST depression induced by exercise |
| `slope` | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| `ca` | Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy |
| `thal` | Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect) |
| `target` | 1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease |
